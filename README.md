This project is a simple web-based calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The HTML structure defines the calculator layout, 
the CSS styles determine its appearance and responsiveness, 
and the JavaScript code handles user input and performs arithmetic operations. 
Open index.html in a web browser to use the calculator.
